# Python--Hotel-Booking-Analysis
__Project Objective__<br>

The objective of the project is to analyze hotel booking data and gain insights into booking patterns, customer behavior, and revenue optimization within the hotel industry. The project aims to identify seasonal variations in bookings, segment customers based on their booking behavior, analyze pricing and revenue trends, By achieving these objectives, the project seeks to provide actionable recommendations for hotels to improve their operations, marketing strategies, and guest experiences.

# Data Analysis
<br>
<b>1.Libraries</b> <br>

Imported the required libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn.By importing these libraries, it can leverage their functions and capabilities to perform data analysis tasks efficiently and effectively in Python. They provide a solid foundation for handling data, performing computations, creating visualizations, and gaining insights from your hotel booking dataset.<br>
<br>
2.<b>Load the dataset</b><br>
Imported the dataset using the file path "pd.read_csv. hotel_df = pd.read_csv("file_path.csv"). After executing this code, you will have the dataset loaded into a pandas DataFrame (hotel_df in this case), which you can use for further analysis and manipulation using pandas functions and methods.
<br><br>
<b>3.Explore the Dataset</b> <br> 
Take a look at the structure and content of the dataset by using functions such as,<br> .head(),<br>.columns(),<br>.describe()<br>
<br>
<br>
# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
<br> **Removing Duplicates**:
Identified duplicate rows or columns using the  **duplicated()** function.
<br>Using the **drop_duplicates()** function dropped the duplicates.
<br>
<br>
**Handling Missing Values:**
<br>
Counted Missing Values by using **sum()**.This allowed me to identify and understand the extent of missing data in the dataset.
Dropped Missing Values by using **drop_na** function. By dropping the missing values the dataset was free from any incomplete or unreliable information.
