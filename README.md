# Python--Hotel-Booking-Analysis
__Project Objective__<br>

The main objective of the Python project on hotel booking analysis is to gain practical experience in utilizing Python programming skills to perform data analysis and derive meaningful insights from a hotel booking dataset. 
<br>
<br>
# Data Analysis
<br>
<b>1.Libraries</b> <br>

Imported the required libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn.By importing these libraries, it can leverage their functions and capabilities to perform data analysis tasks efficiently and effectively in Python. They provide a solid foundation for handling data, performing computations, creating visualizations, and gaining insights from your hotel booking dataset.<br>
<br>
2.<b>Load the dataset</b><br>
Imported the dataset using the file path "pd.read_csv. hotel_df = pd.read_csv("file_path.csv"). After executing this code, you will have the dataset loaded into a pandas DataFrame (hotel_df in this case), which you can use for further analysis and manipulation using pandas functions and methods.
<br><br>
<b>3.Explore the Dataset</b> <br> 
Take a look at the structure and content of the dataset by using functions such as,<br> .head(),<br>.columns(),<br>.describe()<br>
<br>

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
<br> **Removing Duplicates**:
Identified duplicate rows or columns using the  **duplicated()** function.
<br>Using the **drop_duplicates()** function dropped the duplicates.
<br>
<br>
**Handling Missing Values:**
